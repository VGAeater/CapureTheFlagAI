## To Use

To play against the AI run `python3 SimulateCTF.py`. 
To Move around use the arrow keys. 

There is pre existent training data in the .dat files. 
To make new Data run `python3 create.py` which makes new data for both modes more on that later. 
To train the AI run `python3 [mode]SimulateCTF.py`. 
Then afterwards if you would like to get absolutly abliterated by it you may run `python3 SimulateCTF.py`. 

The modes are True and False. 
True means it mutates the loser and False means it replaces the loser with a mutation of the winner.
